<h1>Population estimates and projections - an introduction</h1>
</div>

<div class="row" id = 'section_summary'>

<div class = "content">

<p>Annual estimates of the population living in West Sussex are provided by the Office for National Statistics. The most accurate estimates are drawn from the census, which takes place every 10 years in the UK. Population estimates are then updated every year, mostly using information on births, deaths, and migration, until the next census to produce mid-year population estimates (MYEs). National and local authority estimates are usually updated in June each year by the Office for National Statistics for the previous year (e.g. mid-2018 estimates were released in June 2019), with small area population estimates released later in the year, usually in November.</p>

<p>In addition to understanding the number of people living in the county, it is also important to consider the number of people using health services such as GPs, as these are important populations for public health interventions such as NHS Health Checks, NHS Stop Smoking Services in primary care, and for health protection interventions such as flu vaccines. People do not always go to a GP practice close to where they live and may instead use services closer to where they work. Fortunately, GP practices regularly publish the number of patients by age and sex who are registered to a particular practice.</p>

<p>Trends from recent mid year estimates are also used to project what the population could look like in the next 30 years if those trends continued. It is, of course, likely that unexpected events or policies will have an impact on future population changes and projections cannot take these into account. One uncertainty will be the impact of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union which will influence migration of populations.</p>

<p>This analysis looks at the mid 2018 population estimates, as well as GP registrations, and population projections, to consider the demographics of West Sussex, and what the population of West Sussex may look like in the future.</p>

</div>

<div class = 'right-sidebar'>
  <p class = 'side'>The population estimates refer to the usual residence of a population, it is not a count of how many people are expected to be in an area at a given time (e.g. it does not estimate the number of people who come into an area for work or for tourism). For most people, defining where they usually live is quite straightforward although specific rules are applied to estimate numbers of people in the armed forces, and also the number of students, prisoners, and international migrants.</p>

  <p class = 'side'>Higher education students and schoolchildren studying away from home are counted as residents at their term-time address, members of the armed forces are usually resident at the address where they spend most of their time and prisoners are usually resident in the prison estate if they have a sentence of six months or more. International migrants are usually resident if they intend to stay in England and Wales for more than 12 months.<p>

  <p class = 'side_important'>As the mid year residents figures are estimates rather than counts, there is an expected level of uncertainty and the Office for National Statistics recommends rounding mid year estimates to at least the nearest 100 population in any publication. Whilst we report rounded estimates in the text of this briefing, in some instances, unrounded estimates are used for further calculations such as percentages, ratios, and changes over time. Figures are also based on unrounded estimates.</p>

<p>The 2018 mid year estimates and comparable GP registrations by age and sex are given in the table below.</p>

<p class = 'side_important'>Whilst the total population estimates and population change values in this table are rounded, percentages and ratios are calculated from unrounded values.</p>

<p>The figure below is a population pyramid. This visualises the age and sex structure of a population's estimated resident population and the number of people registered to GP practices operating in the area. You can interact with it and change the area to see differences across West Sussex.</p>
<p>The shape of the pyramid gives an indication of the age structure of a population, if the shape is wider at the top, this is indicative of an ageing population and a pyramid which is wider at the bottom indicates a relatively younger population overall.</p>
<h3>We could have a population pyramid here that is only 2018, but you can switch between areas and have a reference area of lines. This could be bars = resident and lines = gp registered</h3>
<p>Which age groups have more registrations than residents?</p>

<h3>What causes the changes in population?</h3>
<p>The table below shows the 2018 'components of change' figures for our county and its lower tier local authorities (sometimes called districts and boroughs). A components of change table shows how the population is affected by births, deaths, and migration.</p>
<p>To make comparing population changes across areas easier (because some of our districts have almost three times as many residents than others), the values are presented per 1,000 population with the raw value given in brackets.</p>

  <p class = 'side'>Total population estimates are rounded to the nearest 100 although figures for births, deaths and migrations are unrounded.</p>
  <p class = 'side'>To enable comparison between GP registrations and estimates of residents, we have compared the snapshot of GP registrations as close to the time of the estimates as possible (July 2018). There are more recent snapshots available (GP practice lists are updated monthly) and some practices will have closed since July 2018.</p>

<h3>Ageing population</h3>
<p>In West Sussex, the median age in 2018 was 45.1 years, up from 44 years in 2013 and 42.8 years a decade ago in 2008.</p>

<p>The table below shows the median age for each West Sussex district and borough every five years since 2003.</p>
<div id = 'population_median_age_table'></div>

<p>For most districts, the median age has increased by at least three years over the last 15 years although there have been much smaller increases in the north of the county. Moreover, Crawley has consistently maintained a lower median age for its population compared to the rest of the county. In 2018, the median age for residents in Crawley was 37.2 years compared to Arun which had a median age of 49.4 years (a difference of over 12 years).</p>

</div>

<div class = 'right-sidebar'>
  <p class = 'side'>The median age provides a useful summary measure of the age structure of the population as it shows that exactly half the population is below and the other half is above the median age.</p>

<h2>Where do people live within West Sussex?</h2>

<p>In West Sussex, in 2018, there was estimated to be 431 people per square kilometre. There is variation across the county with Chichester having as few as 154 residents per square kilometre and Worthing having more than twenty times this at 3,383 residents per square kilometre. The population density of West Sussex districts has been fairly stable over the last 15 years.</p>

<div class = 'content'>
<h2>Migration</h2>
<p>The chart below shows the net internal migration flow for West Sussex in the year ending June 2016 by age group. It shows that over the 12 months leading to June 2016, more people settled in the county than left for nearly all age groups apart from 15-19 and 20-24 year olds. These young people may be those who leave the family home for the first time to go to university.</p>

<p>The pattern of net internal migration is varied among the districts of West Sussex (shown below), with Crawley showing the inverse of the pattern seen at county level, with 20-24 year olds being the only age group to have a net increase in population.</p>

</div>

<div class = 'right-sidebar'>
  <p class = 'side'>An internal migrant is defined as someone who moves home from one geographical area to another. This may be between local authorities, regions or countries within the UK. Unlike with international migration, there is no internationally agreed definition.</p>

<p class = 'side_important'>Whilst the total population estimates and population change values in this table are rounded, percentages and ratios are calculated from unrounded values.</p>

<p>The latest population estimates for West Sussex indicate the county is home to more than 858,800 residents. Projections based on recent trends indicate that by 2028, the population in West Sussex will increase to more than 925,900 and by 2038, the resident population of West Sussex is expected to reach 976,900.</p>

<h3>What does this mean for ageing in the future?</h3>
<p>In 2018, just over one in five residents (22%) in West Sussex was aged 65 years and over. Over the next decade, this is expected to increase to one in four (26%) and by 2038, 30% (almost one in three) residents will be aged 65 and over. This is much higher than national estimates (18% in 2018, 21% in 2028 and 24% in 2038).</p>

<h3>The old age dependency ratio...</h3>
<p>The old age dependency ratio measures the number of people of state pension age (SPA) and over for every 1,000 people of working age (16 to SPA).</p>
<p>Women's state pension age increased to 65 between April 2016 and November 2018. From December 2018 the SPA for both men and women will increase to reach 66 by October 2020 (Pensions Act 2011). Between 2026 and 2027 SPA will increase to 67 years for both sexes (Pensions Act 2014), SPA will increase to 68 years for both men and women between 2044 and 2046 (Pensions Act 2007).</p>
<p>To calculate the population estimated to be of state pension age by year in this analysis, population estimates are applied to the state pension age matrix available from the Office for National Statistics (<a href = 'https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=%2fpeoplepopulationandcommunity%2fpopulationandmigration%2fpopulationprojections%2fdatasets%2ftableofstatepensionagefactorspensionsact%2f2016based/pensionmatrixfor2016npp.xls'>available here</a>).</p>

<p>In West Sussex...</p>
<p>Remember, this is not an ideal estimate of old age dependency as it assumes that all those above SPA are dependent and that all those of working age are economically active and not infact dependent themselves.</p>

<p>Technologies may change in the future such that people are able to stay healthier and independent for longer and the OADR measure may become less useful as more people work up to and beyond SPA; alternative measures that include economic activity may provide a more meaningful picture of economic dependency.</p>
</div>

<div class = 'right-sidebar'>
  <p class = 'side'>It should be noted that the old age dependency ratio estimates shown here have been calculated from the ONS mid year estimates and 2016 based population projections combined with the state pension age matrix. There may be slight differences in the old age dependency ratio estimates published by ONS for 2016-2014 (<a href = 'https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationprojections/datasets/populationofstatepensionageandworkingageandoldagedependencyratiosforlocalauthoritiesandregionsinengland'>available here</a>).</p>
